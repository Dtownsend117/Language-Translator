How to build and install the fcntl python file
Why is this needed?
Windows (at least on my system) for some reason doesn't install the 'langdetect' PIP package so the fcntl python file is needed to kind 'bypass' the issue

Step 1.) paste the code in a text editor and save it as "fcntl.py"

def fcntl(fd, op, arg=0):
    return 0
        
def ioctl(fd, op, arg=0, mutable_flag=True):
    if mutable_flag:
        return 0
    else:
        return ""
    
def flock(fd, op):
    return
        
def lockf(fd, operation, length=0, start=0, whence=0):
    return

Step 2.) Place the file in the 'site-packages' folder in the python directory
The folder should be located here:
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\site-packages

Now you should be able to install the langdetect PIP package
